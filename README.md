# -Over-Current-Protection-Circuit-
An electronic overcurrent protection circuit designed using IC 555, resistors, and diodes to detect excess current and short-circuit conditions. The circuit triggers a visual alert using an LED when unsafe current levels are detected, helping to protect electronic components from damage.
